				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>For most companies, security is considered a side quest, which is partly related to the daily processes. In reality, security ought to be a strong foundation of any organization. To ensure the defense of the enterprise, the relevant teams need strong security knowledge and abilities. You have to be up to date with the latest security trends, risks. Security awareness and skills require consistent training. Oftentimes it seems that training needs to be enforced into the daily routine, but that’s not the case. It needs to be implemented in the company security program. Over time, security training increases the overall security of the enterprise, but for that to happen, you need to know some best practices.</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>1. Embed security training in developers day-to-day jobs</h3>
<p>Developers care about the product and not about security. It is their job, period. Thus, security has to embed itself into the processes of developers. Some fundamental security awareness training is needed to make sure that developers understand the basic concepts of security, but most of the skill acquisition needs to be situational adapting to the current activities of developers.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>2. Equip developers with hands-on skills to build multiple lines of defenses</h3>
<p>Traditionally, enterprise security training was and still is delivered as a university training course. Most of the training is a one-size-fits-all video or click-through web-based training that leaves developers with a false sense of knowledge. Only when they try to implement what they saw do they realize that they did not fully grasp the concepts and they did not see the tips and tricks of fixing the most common issues. Hands-on training helps them to think like a hacker and empower them to design and build multiple lines of defenses.</p>
<p><img src="https://avatao.com/media/security-training-4-1024x679.png" width="619" height="410" alt="security training" class="wp-image-4069 aligncenter size-large" /></p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>3. A successful enterprise security program needs champions</h3>
<p>A security awareness training for developers should build a solid basic understanding for every developer, but it is unrealistic to assume that most people will fall in love with security. Still, a small but dedicated percentage of people will find this topic to be interesting and quite useful for their career and one can build a security champion program to allow them to progress.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>4. Training for all levels and tech stacks</h3>
<p>Diversify training to match the skill levels and technology stacks for developers. As mentioned before, one of the key turn-offs for developer training is when they have to go through standardized training paths that do not match their daily job, technologies, or do not fit their skill level. It is important to be able to personalize the training on the team and individual level to allow developers to make the most out of their time spent.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>5. Tracking your team’s progress</h3>
<p>It is a common practice to have some sort of tracking and statistics dashboard for training platforms. They usually express the objectives around the training itself, how many hours people trained, a leaderboard about most active users, etc. The real challenge is to make this data actionable and make sure that managers can discover skill gaps and take corrective actions to fix those gaps. A well-rounded training program helps to discover causality between security issues and the skillset of teams. Hence, security training should nicely integrate into the other security controls a company is using to ensure product security.</p>
<p><img src="https://avatao.com/media/build-skills-1-1024x681.png" width="580" height="386" alt="secure code skills" class="wp-image-4154 aligncenter size-large" /></p>
<ol></ol>
<h2>Empower developers to build solid products</h2>
<p>Building an enterprise security program is hard. In the <a href="https://avatao.com/5-key-challenges-when-building-a-security-training-program/">previous article</a>, we talked about the fundamentals of organizational change: People, Process and Technology. We believe that the People Operations are the most important and also the most difficult part of a successful security program. Security training is a great asset to ensure to make the most of human resources. People, unlike Tech and Processes, are unpredictable and can surprise company leaders and managers in both ways. One should use technology to minimize the chance of unpleasant surprises and empower developers to execute an unexpected positive impact on security traditionally driven by security teams. Implementing training in the security program provides the technological environment for the aforementioned empowerment. Through training, developers can increase their secure coding skills, and thus, improve the overall security of your company.</p></div>

Any successful strategy focuses on transforming these three areas, yet different leaders focus their efforts on one or the other.<br /> In this blog, we advocate that transforming the People Operations is the most difficult yet the most rewarding area of the three basic pillars of the enterprise security program. Still, due to the difficulty to express results and the potential long feedback cycle of benefits, most leaders and managers tackle the problems backward, starting with Technology and work towards People.<br /> </strong></p>
<h2>The first line of defense</h2>
<p>People will always be the primary source of errors and vulnerabilities but they are also the first line of defense against cybersecurity threats. Even with the most sophisticated technology in place, it was always the great people who discovered that something went wrong (ex <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html">FireEye</a> and <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/continuous-updates-everything-you-need-know-about-solarwinds-attack">SolarWinds</a> attack).</p>
<p>Traditionally, security was thought to be the job of the security team. A well-rounded enterprise security program, however, should extend this responsibility to each employee to some extent. More and more businesses depend on the security and correct operation of their software products and hence secure coding training for developers becomes an essential part of a solid enterprise security program.</p>

<ol></ol>
<h2>The most common challenges businesses may face</h2>
<p>Building a security program has never been an easy and straightforward task. There is a great number of factors to be considered in the process. Sometimes it seems like an unnecessary struggle, but the outcome always proves the opposite. On your way towards a well-built security program, you may meet several challenges. We collected the most common ones for you.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>1. Developers care about speed</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: The main objective of software developers is to ship code as fast as possible without breaking the whole product. Developers care about committing the features to production that makes the most short-term impact on users.<br /> Yet, by now most developers understood that software development is not a sprint but a marathon where you build up a product step-by-step. Hasty planning and hurry to ship code in a few sprints can cause the accumulation of technical and security debt. This might not hurt in the short run, but eventually, any product will collapse under scale and pressure when it was built on weak foundations. For most developers, this process and the effects are clear in case of testing or code optimization, but not in security.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>2. Developers lack security education and training</h3>
<p>The importance of testing is now part of every computer science curriculum. Unit tests, integration tests, and TDD, in general, became commonly accepted best practices for high-quality software development. The same is not true for secure coding training for CS students. Cybersecurity is still a missing part of the computer science curricula in most universities worldwide.</p>
<p><img src="https://avatao.com/file/secure-code.png" width="515" height="434" alt="" class="wp-image-3802 aligncenter size-full" srcset="https://avatao.com/media/secure-code.png 648w, https://avatao.com/media/secure-code-300x253.png 300w, https://avatao.com/media/secure-code-480x404.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /></p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>3. Security training is considered a necessary evil</h3>
<p>Training, especially company-driven training, is one of those activities where the feedback and results show up with a significant delay. Very few people are dedicated enough to improve their skills consistently and systematically day-by-day. Most developers believe that on-the-job experience will lead them forward. Organized training by companies is considered a pain and a necessary evil that drives them away from their daily job.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>4. Security is a gateway function that blocks modern DevOps processes</h3>
<p>Security is traditionally considered as an obstacle that hinders people from doing their job. Like the early days, seatbelts were considered a bad thing as they limited people in their free movement while driving. Similarly, developers often consider visible guardrails and tools of security useless cycles of programming that prevents them from going with full speed in shipping products.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>5. Misalignment of responsibilities</h3>
<p>Many developers have a strong sense of responsibility towards their code, but some developers simply do not care if their code is high-quality or not. If the processes allow them to slack, these developers will sacrifice long-term stability for short-term speed. Since most developers are not directly responsible for the mistakes they make, they might optimize for speed, not quality.</p>
<ol></ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Awareness of the importance of security training is on the rise, but it still has a long way to go. It is often considered as a setback that slows down the workflow, but as mentioned earlier, the positive effects of security training in the long term are indisputable. Just like any process related to products and services, security needs a strong base to be built on. Training is an essential part of the foundation of any successful security program, and even if it seems to derail the day-to-day job, incorporating it improves code quality and overall security. In the next blog post we&#8217;ll discuss some best practices on how to implement training in your security program. Stay tuned!</p></div>

Programmers like to try new things out but is it worth it to pick one of them over Java? Is it worth getting started with Kotlin? We&#8217;re going to explore the topic in this article.</strong></p>
<h2>What is Kotlin?</h2>
<p>Kotlin is a general purpose programming language that was written by JetBrains (the creators of IntelliJ IDEA), runs on the JVM and compiles to Java bytecode. The creators wanted a language that is essentially a better Java to be used for their own projects.</p>
<p>If you read the pitch on the JetBrains website you might see things like &#8220;It lets you achieve more with less code&#8221;, &#8220;Solve a lot of problems in Java&#8221; or &#8220;It does well compared to the alternatives (Clojure, Scala)&#8221; but what does this mean in practice?</p>
<h2>Kotlin Doesn&#8217;t Reinvent the Wheel</h2>
<p>You might have seen initiatives in the past to start using <em>Clojure</em>, <em>Scala</em> or some other language on a project. This usually comes up when developers get bored (or frustrated) and they want something which is more powerful or has more features than Java.</p>
<p>Justifying the switch however is very hard. The problem with these languages is that they come with their own tooling (<code>sbt</code>, <code>leiningen</code>, etc) and their own idioms. There are many barriers to entry, and the learning curve is often steep even if you stay on the JVM platform.</p>
<p>This is not all though. Introducing a new language also comes with costs. People have to learn it, and the tooling has to be built around it. This means that in most cases it is not worth it to do so.</p>
<p>This is where Kotlin shines. The language was designed in a way that it doesn&#8217;t introduce new paradigms, it just improves the existing ones. It also has seamless interoperability with Java, so the two languages can co-exist in the same project without significant problems.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Kotlin uses the same tooling as Java programmers are used to: <em>Maven</em>, <em>Gradle</em> and others.</p>
<h2>Getting started with Kotlin</h2>
<p>So how does Kotlin improve the quality of our programs? Let&#8217;s look at some examples.</p>
<h2>Less Code, Better Results</h2>
<p>What you see below is a typical Java object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * A plain old Java object with all the boilerplate.
 */
public class HexagonValueObject {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;
    private final int z;
    public HexagonValueObject(int x, int y, int z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.z = z;
    }
    public int getX() {
        return x;
    }
    public int getY() {
        return y;
    }
    public int getZ() {
        return z;
    }
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        HexagonValueObject hexagon = (HexagonValueObject) o;
        return getX() == hexagon.getX() &amp;&amp;
                getY() == hexagon.getY() &amp;&amp;
                getZ() == hexagon.getZ();
    }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(getX(), getY(), getZ());
    }
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "HexagonValueObject{" +
                "x=" + x +
                ", y=" + y +
                ", z=" + z +
                '}';
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>What&#8217;s worth noting here is that all this 50 lines of code was written to implement a very simple concept: a 3 dimensional position with <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> coordinates. This is why folks call Java a <em>verbose</em> language. Wouldn&#8217;t it better if we could do this with less code while still retaining the functionality?<br /> Let&#8217;s see how Kotlin improves upon this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">data class HexagonDataClass(val x: Int, val y: Int, val z: Int)</code></pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all you have to write with Kotlin. The readability is improved and there are also less places where something can go wrong.</p>
<h2>Kotlin Program Safety</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with Java is <code>null</code> which was also called the <a href="https://medium.com/@hinchman_amanda/null-pointer-references-the-billion-dollar-mistake-1e616534d485">Billion Dollar Mistake</a>. Kotlin works around this problem by adding a notation (<code>?</code>) to indicate nullability. In Java no one can be sure that a reference to an object is not <code>null</code> just by looking at the code, but in Kotlin this is enforced by the compiler. This is a tremendous help when you try to write robust programs.</p>
<p>Kotlin&#8217;s type system was designed in a way that it will get out of your way when you want to write code by using a clever type inference algorithm but will help you write robust and safe code by allowing you to catch more bugs just by using the appropriate types.</p>
<h2>Augmenting Old Code</h2>
<p>A lot of developers I know are weary of <em>legacy code</em>. Code which was written long time ago, what no one dares to touch and what&#8217;s just sitting there doing its job until it breaks down. Kotlin gives us some features which go around this problem: we no longer have to touch old code, but wrap it with new code. These so called <em>extension functions </em>and properties are a powerful tool with which we can put these problems to rest.</p>
<p>This technique is called decoration in Java, and there are some limitations to it which make it infeasible for legacy projects, not to mention the amount of code which needs to be written to create one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class ListPresenterDecorator&lt;T&gt; extends AbstractList&lt;T&gt; {
    private List&lt;T&gt; list;
    public ListPresenterDecorator(List&lt;T&gt; list) {
        this.list = list;
    }
    public String present() {
        return list.stream()
                .map(Object::toString)
                .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
    }
    @Override
    public T get(int index) {
        return list.get(index);
    }
    @Override
    public int size() {
        return list.size();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent in Kotlin looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;.present() = this.joinToString(", ")</code></pre>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve seen that instead of trying to reinvent the wheel Kotlin embraces existing models and paradigms and improves them. This might be the reason why a lot of people call Kotlin a Turbo Java, or simply <em>the New Java</em>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at some things which are often overlooked, but are very important for Kotlin&#8217;s success.</p>
<h2>Kotlin Multiplatform</h2>
<p>Kotlin is a <em>multiplatform</em> language. What this means is that we only have to write the code <em>once</em> and it can be compiled to a wide array of different platforms including the <em>browser</em>, or your iPhone.</p>
<p>There is another language which is wildly successful because it does the same: Javascript. You might remember when no one used it outside of the browser and then suddenly everybody was using it everywhere. All of this was enabled by improving the tooling of the language: <em>node.js</em>, and <em>Babel</em> are just some of the examples.</p>
<p>Kotlin follows a similar strategy. You can configure your build pipeline using Kotlin (Gradle), write code which runs in the browser with Kotlin using any Javascript library (React is the most common) and write your server code with Kotlin as well. This means that it is enough to know one language to be able to work on any task which enables true full stack development.</p>
<h2>Kotlin Adoption</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen that Kotlin is a truly versatile language, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter if no one uses it. I&#8217;ve got some good news for you! You might have heard that Kotlin is an officially supported language on the Android and it is backed by <em>Google</em>, but this might lead you to think that it is not used elsewhere.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/kotlin/">State of Kotlin</a> survey the language is widely used on the server as well pushing out languages such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8IQ-X2HkGE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=375">Scala</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is very simple: the language was designed for ease of use and interoperability, that&#8217;s why developers looking for an upgrade in productivity flock to it. This is also the reason why Kotlin support for <em>Spring</em>, which is one of the biggest server frameworks for Java was <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0">announced </a>and why Gradle also <a href="https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-build-logic-from-groovy-to-kotlin/">added support</a>.</p>
<h2>Where to Start with Kotlin?</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve seen that the language is ideal as a next step for seasoned Java developers the only question is &#8220;Where to start?&#8221;. Luckily for us there is a lot of learning material out there that will help you getting started with Kotlin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://next.avatao.com/events/kotlin-fundamentals/details"> Try Avatao’s Kotlin fundamentals training for free and get access to our extensive training library for teams. </a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s less commonly known is that there is a Java -&gt; Kotlin converter tool built into IDEA which anybody can use. All we have to do is to paste Java code into a Kotlin <code>.kt</code> file and IDEA will convert the code for us. Since Kotlin code can sit next to Java code we can start using Kotlin by converting some of our Java classes to Kotlin to see how it works.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to commit to the language just yet another good option is to start writing your unit tests in Kotlin. This will help with getting up to speed with Kotlin without the fear of introducing production bugs into our existing application.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning a new language is always fun and if it can be justified from the business perspective it is even better. Kotlin is one of those languages which are in the sweet spot when it comes to pragmatism and elegance.</p>
<p>Adopting it has much less up front costs than other languages and people become more productive with it much faster. It also has a beneficial effect on the talent pool: programmers who are willing to learn new languages and people who are always looking for ways to improve will flock to it.</p>
<p>This will become a differentiating factor when you&#8217;re doing recruitment for your company which will probably result in more skilled candidates eager to jump on the opportunity to write code in Kotlin.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>How can we make security education a whole lot more accessible and fun? The tutorial framework is the answer. In this article we dive into how to create interactive learning environments running inside containers.</p>
<h2 id="the-phantom-menace">The Phantom Menace</h2>
<p>Something is not quite right with cybersecurity. As our industry slowly realizes how big of an issue it is, the more we seem to be failing at it. But why is this the case? ​​</p>
<p>The number of programmers in the world is doubling roughly every five years [1]. If you think about it, this means that at any given point in time, half the programmers have less than five years of experience. As long as this is the case we will never have enough experts and the demand for seasoned engineers can never be satisfied. ​</p>
<p>This keeps our industry in a constant state of inexperience. Even worse, there is no escape from this: the demand for developers just keeps on increasing as software is devouring our society as a whole. And boy, is that software ugly. That software is the worst million lines of legacy braindeath nobody dares to touch at your organisation. We all have it, we’ve all seen it and we all know it’s not going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>​ <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.avatao.com/images/this_is_fine.jpeg?w=1170&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" class="jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled" data-lazy-loaded="1" />If you throw security into this whole mix, it gets even worse. ITSec still seems to be an exotic topic at universities and we have generations of professionals stuck without a proper background in security and there is not much we can do about that. ​</p>
<p>At this point, our best bet is to try and build a culture of conscious developers. Software craftsmanship is an excellent starting point, providing an approach to software development which is capable of resolving many of the issues plaguing our industry. However, even in an utopian world filled with responsible professionals, security issues would still require some special treatment (training, QA, security audits, pentesting, etc.). ​</p>
<p>Security shouldn’t be just an afterthought or just an other feature on our backlogs. Our whole industry is built on technologies where we’ve “hacked in” security after something went <em>seriously</em> wrong. It seems like this is not really sustainable anymore and perhaps it’s time we took a different approach: We should design and build our software systems with security in mind from the ground up. The only way we could achieve this is by making education a whole lot more accessible and fun. ​</p>
<p>Of course this issue is far too complex to simply be solved by some magical new idea or technology, but with some luck and tons of determination we just might make it together, one step at a time. ​</p>
<p>[1]: “Uncle” Bob Martin – The Future of Programming ​</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope">A New Hope: The Tutorial Framework</h2>
<p><a href="https://avatao.com/">Our company</a><span> </span>has a long history of building hacking labs and CTF challenges. These exercises provide awesome hands-on experience, but their learning curve can be quite steep without a strong background in security. Our goal was to make these exercises more accessible without sacrificing their teaching potential. ​</p>
<p>The Tutorial Framework (TFW) allows you to create interactive learning environments running inside containers. These environments are capable of automatically guiding users through a set of topics by allowing them to interact with real software through a simple web browser. Users can attack web services, write some code to fix the vulnerabilities they’ve just exploited and use a terminal to deploy their changes. The tutorial framework gives you tools to track user progress, run test cases to check their solutions and even offer context dependent help based on the results. ​</p>
<p>Sounds cool, doesn’t it? You can take the whole thing on a test drive <a href="https://next.avatao.com/events/owasp-top-10-intro/details">right here</a>! ​</p>
<p>This framework allowed us to create tutorials in which you still get that “oh I’ve hacked something” breeze, but you are not on your own and have interactive help during the process. We’ve been using this tool internally for more than a year now and created around 200 exercises with it. A few months ago we’ve decided to open source it right before DevSecCon Seattle, where I gave a short talk on it. ​</p>
<h2 id="our-naboo-royal-starship">Our Naboo Royal Starship</h2>
<p>​The tutorial framework is essentially a set of useful components for building interactive labs. These include, but are not limited to: ​</p>
<ul>
<li>Chat to communicate with the user</li>
<li>Code editor (IDE) and console</li>
<li>A terminal</li>
<li>Process management, live process logs</li>
<li>Finite state machines to track user progress ​</li>
</ul>
<p>These built-ins are quite modular, so developers can opt-in to choose the ones they want to use in their tutorials. All of them come with sane defaults, but are also heavily customizable, so for instance you would be able to instruct the code editor to only show <code>.py</code> files under a given path, or change which process has its live logs displayed in the console. Most of our built-ins are implemented as backend services communicating with Angular components on the frontend.</p>
<h2>See the tutorial framework in action<span> </span><a href="https://next.avatao.com/events/owasp-top-10-intro/details">on our platform.</a></h2>
<p>The tutorial framework also offers tooling to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running arbitrary processes inside your container (supervisord)</li>
<li>Reverse proxying webservers, so the whole thing is exposed over a single port (nginx)</li>
<li>Reaping zombie processes (tini)</li>
<li>Integrating a web application into our frontend (so it’s right next to a code editor with it’s source tree for instance)</li>
<li>and more … ​</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole package is conveniently shipped as a Docker baseimage available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avatao/baseimage-tutorial-framework">DockerHub</a>. ​</p>
<h2 id="welcome-on-board">Welcome on Board!</h2>
<p>​The foundation of the tutorial framework is a messaging system built on <a href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>. This IPC mechanism can be used to orchestrate and monitor the built-ins mentioned in the previous section. It is implemented as a daemon called TFW server, with the purpose of providing a robust way for processes to communicate with each other and the TFW frontend. ​</p>
<p>We send and receive simple JSON messages to do RPC and event advertisement over this IPC system. For example sending the following JSON message to the TFW server would display a message in the chat on the frontend: ​</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
    "key": "message.send",
    "message": "Hey there!",
}
</code></pre>
<p>​</p>
<p>Or you could use the following message to type and execute <code>ls</code> in the built-in terminal on the frontend (note the <code>\n</code>, without that it would just pre-type the command for the user): ​</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
    "key": "terminal.write",
    "command": "ls\n"
}
</code></pre>
<p>You get the picture. ​</p>
<p>When something of note happens, the framework advertises these events by broadcasting similar messages. A simple example would be the message triggered by the user typing something in the code editor on the frontend: ​</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
    "key": "ide.write",
    "content": "I like cats"
}
</code></pre>
<p>​Creating an exercise with the tutorial framework usually involves subscribing to these events and deciding what should happen based on the current state of the tutorial and the received message. For instance you could listen for <code>ide.write</code> events, try to compile &amp; run the code found in the <code>content</code> field and notify the user of success when the code passes certain test cases. ​</p>
<h2 id="disassembling-the-hyperdrive">Disassembling the Hyperdrive</h2>
<p>On a high level the framework looks like this:</p>
<p>​ The TFW server could be described as a router. Its job is routing messages between processes running inside the container (ZMQ) and the frontend (WebSockets). Processes capable of receiving messages from the TFW server are called <em>handlers</em>. All of our built-in components are implemented as such processes. Our frontend is a simple Angular web application. ​</p>
<p>Routing decisions are based on the optional <code>scope</code> field of messages. By default every message is forwarded to the backend (ZMQ) side. With setting the value of <code>scope</code>, it is possible to override this default behaviour and talk to the frontend directly (WebSockets) or even broadcast messages to both sides. ​</p>
<p>Our frontend is mostly just a thin display layer, all logic and state tries to “live” on the backend. Furthermore, client code is never required to send messages directly to the frontend, as our components try to expose a simple API and abstract this whole “routing between frontend and backend” deal away. This means that our built-in handlers negotiate with the frontend on their own to hide this complexity from challenge developers, so that they won’t have to worry about <em>how</em> the whole thing works. In addition, this also gives us a great deal of engineering flexibility, as we could potentially rewrite the entire frontend without breaking any client code. ​</p>
<p>Given this modular architecture, you could consider every handler a plug-in to the framework. This approach forces a layer of isolation between components, reducing coupling and keeping individual parts simple, reusable and testable. For instance, changes to the IDE handler will not affect other parts of the system, making it harder to introduce fragility and increasing overall fault tolerance. This flexibility makes adding new features a really simple and painless procedure while reducing the chances of breaking something as well. ​</p>
<p>One such plug-in is our pipe IO subsystem, which allows you to communicate with the framework over POSIX named pipes. Developers can just simply use the <code>open()</code>, <code>write()</code> and <code>read()</code> system calls, pretending that they are writing and reading files without <code>seek()</code>. This is practical if you wished to avoid indulging yourself in the wonders of socket programming. ​</p>
<p>By default the <code>/run/tfw</code> directory is being monitored for file system events (via inotify) by the tutorial framework, allowing us to send and receive messages from a simple bash shell: ​</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[user@448c2ccf2b55 ~]$ cd /run/tfw/
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ # this will be detected by the framework:
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ mkfifo send recv
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ ls
recv  send
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ # receive a single message:
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ head -1 recv
{"content": "some text", "filename": "/home/user/workdir/cica", "key": "ide.write"}
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ # write to the chat by sending a message:
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ echo '{"key": "message.send", "message": "I came from a fifo!"}' &gt; send
[user@448c2ccf2b55 tfw]$ 
</code></pre>
<p>​Note that the direction of fifos (send or receive) is determined by their names (they have to match the pattern <code>*send*</code> or <code>*recv*</code>). ​</p>

<div class="blog_content">
<p>Containers have been around for over a decade. Yet before Docker’s explosive success beginning in 2013 they were not wide-spread or well-known. Long gone are the days of chroot, containers are all the rage, and with them we have a whole new set of development and security challenges.</p>
<h2><strong>Prehistoric times – chroot and jails</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://avatao.com/life-before-docker-and-beyond-a-brief-history-of-container-security/&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot&quot;">Chroot</a> was first introduced in 1979 during the development of Unix V7, 40 years ago. It was created to change the apparent root filesystem of a process and its children. Nothing more, there were no network namespaces or modern process isolation. In 2000, FreeBSD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail">jails</a> extended upon chroot and introduced further sandboxing features. Jails have their own network interfaces with their own IP addresses, disallowing raw sockets by default. This started to resemble virtual machines.</p>
<p>The Linux community shortly followed suit with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-VServer">Linux-VServer</a> in 2001 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ">OpenVZ</a> in 2005. Both were out-of-tree patches to the Linux kernel, and thus relatively complex to maintain. They provided decent network and process isolation but also came with some shortcomings. It didn’t help that hosting providers sold these containers as light-weight virtual machines, making people frustrated that they couldn’t do things they could do with VMs.</p>
<h2><strong>Middle Ages – cgroups, namespaces and LXC</strong></h2>
<p>Control groups (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a>) are a Linux kernel feature introduced in 2008 to isolate the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc) of groups of processes. It went through lots of changes over the years but kept its main purpose, which is to provide a unified interface for process isolation in the Linux kernel. Cgroups were redesigned in 2013, along with a new feature called Linux <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">namespaces</a>. Namespaces partition kernel resources so that a process in one namespace cannot see resources of other namespaces. It’s still an ongoing work to make almost every part of the Linux kernel namespace-aware. The most important ones are mount, process ID, network, interprocess communication and user namespace. Cgroups and namespaces changed everything, as they are the building blocks of all modern container technologies on Linux.</p>
<p>Also in 2008, <a href="https://avatao.com/life-before-docker-and-beyond-a-brief-history-of-container-security/&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC&quot;">LXC</a> was born built on cgroups and namespaces. It was the first accessible container tool that worked with the upstream Linux kernel. However, the early versions were less secure than its prehistoric relatives, Linux-VServer and OpenVZ. Root in an LXC container meant root on the host. This was no longer the case with LXC 1.0 which introduced unprivileged containers with the help of user namespaces.</p>
<p>CloudFoundry entered the game with <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/warden">Warden</a> in 2011 using LXC under the hood. It had separate server and client components, intended to manage containers across a cluster of machines. They later replaced LXC with their own platform agnostic implementation. Warden containers usually only had two layers: a read-only OS root filesystem and a runtime filesystem from building blocks called buildpacks. CloudFoundry is still around but they’ve abandoned Warden in favour of modern standards.</p>
<p>Google, whose engineers invented cgroups, already playing a leading role in the container world also introduced their open-source tool in 2013 called Let Me Contain That For You. <a href="https://github.com/google/lmctfy">LMCTFY</a> never got off the ground as development halted when they started contributing to new standard components in 2015 and introduced nsjail. More on those later.</p>
<p>Systemd too has an answer to containers: <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html">systemd-nspawn</a>. Implied by its name, it manages Linux namespaces and systemd itself can be used to restrict resource usage with cgroups. It is a decent alternative to LXC and obviously integrates well within the systemd ecosystem.</p>
<p>What these early container tools lack are container <strong>images</strong>. You have to create the root filesystem for chroot or bind mount parts of the host system in read-only mode. Of course, you could just extract an archive containing the entire rootfs, or create a filesystem snapshot, but most people aren’t distribution and automation experts. Furthermore, simple archives have no concept of additional container metadata.</p>
<h2><strong>Mainstream Popularity – Docker</strong></h2>
<p>Enter Docker, invented by dotCloud, Inc. in 2013. What Docker did right from the start is the invention of docker images and the Dockerfile. They also created a registry to host images, taking care of the distribution part. Anybody could create a docker image which anybody could run on their machine with a simple command. It all quickly lead to mainstream success. But it was not without cost, decades of best practices flew out the window.</p>
<p>That was a little harsh but a lot of wheels had to be reinvented because everything was bundled together in images. There is no way to update vulnerable dependencies without rebuilding every affected image. You might not even be able to rebuild an image if it isn’t reproducible – which usually isn’t a requirement. Hashes of image layers were not deterministic. There was no way to cryptographically sign images for a long time. Build dependencies and artifacts were left in image layers resulting in bloat. There were no guide-lines on how to manage secrets. Many people treated Docker as an alternative to virtual machines… People run images built by random people from the internet without any kind of verification.</p>
<p>But since then, there are multiple tools to scan images for vulnerabilities and multiple ways to sign images. Image layers are deterministic. There are multi-stage builds and layer squashing. There are a lot of popular well-maintained official images and alternative registries to Docker Hub. Slowly, new best-practices emerged.</p>
<p>In the early days, Docker was also built on LXC which they’ve abandoned for their in-house container library. Until they’ve implemented user namespaces, running processes as root in docker containers was similarly dangerous. There are a multitude of <a href="https://blog.avatao.com/An-overview-of-Linux-container-security/">security features</a> to further lock down containers. Docker now supports a generous number of backing filesystems from overlayfs through devicemapper to BTRFS. (I’ll skip the terrors of aufs and the early days of overlayfs.) Docker also has separate client and server components which is a considerable attack vector. Anybody who has access to the docker daemon can gain root on the host.</p>
<p>They started adding complementary features such as Swarm mode to manage a cluster of docker daemons, secret management and more. This went against the Unix philosophy of building interoperable parts that did one thing well. Docker, Inc. took some controversial steps trying to monetize their business. For example, dropping long-term support for community releases. Alternatives started to emerge and suddenly there was a need for standards.</p>
<p>Docker also has a desktop application for Mac OS which utilizes a light-weight Linux VM that brings some of its own challenges. Docker on Windows is similar, except it supports native Windows containers and also works in Windows Subsystem for Linux – courtesy of Microsoft. So by now it really is “build anywhere, run anywhere”.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternatives – rkt</strong></h2>
<p>CoreOS – recently acquired by RedHat – announced <a href="https://github.com/rkt/rkt/">rkt</a> in late 2014 as a response to Docker, focusing on standards and compatibility. Rkt integrates tightly with systemd which Docker was pushing hard against at the time. It implemented pods – groups of containers sharing [some] namespaces. It had pluggable execution stages, so you could use systemd-nspawn, simple chroot or even light-weight virtual machines with KVM or Xen. Of course, all compatible with plain old docker images. Eventually, standards and common libraries were created and rkt started fading away. It achieved its original purpose.</p>
<h2><strong>Open Foundations – The Beginning of Standardization</strong></h2>
<p>In mid-2015, the <a href="https://www.opencontainers.org/about">Open Container Initiative</a> was born under the Linux Foundation’s umbrella, founded by Docker, CoreOS and other leaders in the container industry. OCI is a governance structure for creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime. It hosts important projects such as <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runC</a> which is a CLI tool – donated by Docker – to run containers according to the OCI specification. RunC is widely used in modern container stacks.</p>
<p>An older, equally important project for containers is the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>, also a part of the Linux Foundation. CNCF hosts a plethora of open-source container-related projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, containerd, CNI, CRI-O and many more.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">Containerd</a> is a daemon for Linux and Windows that manages the complete container lifecycle of its host. It supports the OCI image and runtime specifications via runC. Many projects use it internally such as Docker or Kubernetes.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking">Container Network Interface</a> provides specification and libraries for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers from simple bridges to custom overlay networks. CNI is also a key part of modern container stacks.</p>
<h2><strong>Orchestration Wars – Kubernetes</strong></h2>
<p>Back in 2014 while standards in the container industry still seemed like a pipe dream, another important project came to light. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> was launched by engineers at Google, heavily influenced by experience with Google’s internal container orchestration systems. It quickly attracted contributors from key players in the industry such as RedHat, CoreOS and Intel. Kubernetes is a complex system for automating deployment, management and scaling of containers. It was adopted by the CNCF, along with most of its key components. Kubernetes first used Docker as its container runtime. But now it supports any runtime via the Container Runtime Interface, such as <a href="https://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a> which implements this interface via containerd and runC.</p>
<p>Docker’s slice of the orchestration pie was <a href="https://github.com/docker/swarm">Swarm</a> which is a standalone tool for managing a cluster of docker daemons via the same API. It was superseded by <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Swarm mode</a> which is included in Docker since version 1.12. Kubernetes’ ever growing popularity and faster development cycle overshadowed Swarm. Here at Avatao we used both Swarm and mostly Kubernetes for different purposes.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning <a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/">Marathon</a>, a container orchestration system for Apache Mesos and <a href="https://dcos.io/">DC/OS</a> which is a distributed cloud operating-system based on the Mesos distributed systems kernel. But that’s a topic for another time.</p>
<h2><strong>Alternatives – Podman</strong></h2>
<p>With all these open standards it is now relatively easy to build compatible container stacks. <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> is a CLI tool started by RedHat, built on industry standards. It is mostly CLI compatible with Docker but it works without a daemon with user namespaces. That means every user on the host system has their own context with their own uid mapping. Podman does not support docker-compose because they believe Kubernetes is the defacto standard for pods and as such it supports launching pods from Kubernetes manifests for local development. But there is a <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">podman-compose</a> project nonetheless. Podman is strictly meant to be a CLI tool, for a daemon-based setup there is containerd, for Kubernetes there is CRI-O.</p>
<p>Some of the related tools from RedHat are skopeo and buildah. <a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo/">Skopeo</a> is a tool for managing OCI and original docker images and registries. It supports copying from various storage backends, inspecting images locally or from registries, deleting images and so on. <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah">Buildah</a> is a tool with the sole purpose of building OCI and docker images in a more traditional way.</p>
<h2><strong>Nsjail – For All of Us Hackers</strong></h2>
<p>I wouldn’t call <a href="https://github.com/google/nsjail">nsjail</a> an alternative to docker, it is a light-weight process isolation tool that also happens to be utilizing namespaces, cgroups and seccomp. Nsjail is not for running images, it is for manually configuring chroot, namespaces, cgroups and seccomp like Frankenstein. The target audience are security researchers and developers – it’s not for the faint hearted.</p>
<p>For instance, some emulators do not like being confined to containers… They even have interactive setups for accepting licenses and refuse to run multiple instances. They usually require gigabytes of stuff. Creating a docker image would be a lot of effort. So let’s configure the emulator on the host then run it with nsjail. In inetd mode to create instances on demand, in an isolated network namespace, and with overlayfs on top of the bind mounted data directory. Now, for every incoming connection to a port, we get an emulator instance in a container which is none the wiser. Changes to the filesystem are only made on the overlay filesystem. If this sounds like if it was for a Capture the Flag competition, it’s because it was.</p>
<h2><strong>Back to the Future – Light-weight Virtual Machines</strong></h2>
<p>As container tools matured so did virtual machines. The benefit of containers over VMs is that they’re light-weight thus much more easily scalable and they start in milliseconds instead of minutes. But VMs aren’t necessarily the slow behemoths they used be. This revolution started with the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/644675/">Clear Containers</a> project by Intel. Essentially, there is no need for BIOS or UEFI, it jumps directly into the Linux kernel which can be booted in less than a second without complex hardware drivers. Imagine combining the simplicity of container images with the robustness and security of hardware assisted VMs. This inspired various projects such as <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a> which is an active project growing in popularity or Amazon’s <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker</a> microVMs.</p>
<h2><strong>Containerized Desktop Applications</strong></h2>
<p>Myself and a couple of like-minded scientists started experimenting with containerizing desktop applications some years ago. Especially proprietary applications that only supported a specific distribution, such as Skype for work. Check out <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/">@jessfraz</a>. Basically, you bind mount everything the application needs from the host: the X11 socket, the Wayland socket, the PulseAudio socket, you have to have the same user ID and credentials in the container… You see where this is going. I’ve given up on it as it was a constant pain to maintain.</p>
<p>Some time passes and <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> was introduced, a container-based technology for building and distributing desktop applications on Linux. Flatpak actually has a long <a href="https://flatpak.org/about/">history</a> going back before Docker even existed but it only took its current name in 2016, and then was endorsed by RedHat and others. Containers are only secondary in Flatpak’s story. Desktop environments and frameworks needed to catch up for them to be seamlessly integrated with sandboxed applications. Flatpak does everything we needed to do manually before. It also implemented <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/694291/">portals</a> for file choosers, printing, notifications, etc. There are also community maintained repositories (remotes), most importantly, <a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>However, just because an app runs with Flatpak, it doesn’t mean it’s completely locked down and secure. If you’re still using X11, it is exposed to attacks, there is no way around this. An application might specify that it needs access to your entire home directory, although that is generally avoided and can be overridden.</p>
<p>Also check out <a href="https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Silverblue</a>, a desktop distribution based on containers where the host system is immutable, backed by <a href="https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">OSTree</a>. Everything runs in containers, be it a desktop application with Flatpak, a system service with runC or a regular docker container. This is all fascinating but still tiresome for a developer who often needs to tinker with their system.</p>
<h2><strong>Closing remarks</strong></h2>
<p>As you can see, a lot more has happened in the last 5-6 years since Docker’s introduction than in the 30 years from chroot to cgroups and namespaces. The industry is still trying to catch up to containers and orchestration systems. But containers are already not the latest technological stepping stone. Serverless is the next big thing which abstracts away everything this post was about and focuses on the application instead. Because in the end, all that matters is the application. Serverless reminds me of the ancient days of enterprise Java where you would just write what you want and it happened – or not. It’s an endless cycle.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 30px;">Cybersecurity: a tough reality</strong></p>
<div class="blog_content">
<p>Cybersecurity is an inherently negative asset. As with any protective measure, the major challenge is to <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/cybersecurity-roi-oxymoron/">measure the value (or Return on Investment, ROI) of cybersecurity</a>. It is significantly more difficult to make this value apparent to stakeholders: customers, users and decision-makers in the company. When all goes well, the investment in security is not really justified. When there is an attack and disaster hits, it is too late to think about fixing problems and so, the blame-game begins.</p>
<p>Usually, companies that have been targeted by attacks mainly focus on putting out fires, that is to recover business operations and patch the obvious holes.</p>
<p>Not only is security a negative asset, but is also a preventive one.</p>
<p>Majority of the value of the investment made in security only shows up after the security defenses catch a major attack or when companies pass a tough business audit because of proper measures. In general, the <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3072940/why-the-ciso-is-the-hardest-tech-role-to-fill.html">task of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or another security leader for that matter is quite difficult</a>, because they need to prepare for the inevitable without any substantial evidence to justify the budget.</p>
<p>That being said, it is not surprising to see many argue that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-dismal-industry-the-unsustainable-burden-of-cyber-security/">security in general is a dismal industry</a> that is not providing any stellar value to consumers, and yet demands a lot of resources.</p>
<h2><strong>And yet, security is a must.</strong></h2>
<p>In the early days of any industry, security isn’t usually a part of a product. When cars were first introduced, the emphasis was on functionality. Yet, a few years after the first car hit the market, the first car was stolen and security became an issue.</p>
<p>As a response, the <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-first-car-alarm-was-sort-of-like-a-puzzle-471797268">first car alarm was invented</a>. Similarly, the Internet was not designed with security in mind as it was initially a closeted and trusted research network for researchers.</p>
<p>As with any technology, once the major features are built and adoption is wide-spread, safety, reliability and security assume the status of bigger issues.</p>
<p>The problem here is that security is often looked at as an afterthought, that solves point in time problems.</p>
<p>When technology evolves, security solutions need to be replaced. Many argue that security should stop being a bolt-on solution and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/bolt-on-security-comes-under-fire/">should be part of the product design and development from the very beginning</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>The value of cybersecurity</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s the ‘vicious’ cycle of cybersecurity:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">It is very important that all participants in software product design work together to break this cycle. Software developers need to build systems that are secure by design (especially in </span><a href="https://platform.avatao.com/paths/c7b22cf2-3044-42ca-bfc4-308d3023034d/info" style="font-size: 19px;">web application security</a><span style="font-size: 19px;">, and </span><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/information-cyber-security/secure-by-design" style="font-size: 19px;">secure coding</a><span style="font-size: 19px;">).</span></p>
<p>It is imperative we see that <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/how-cybersecurity-teams-can-convince-the-c-suite-of-their-value">cybersecurity teams can deliver great value to the business</a></strong> if they are treated as internal consultants and value centers rather than a cost center. The major problem is that developers and product managers need cybersecurity to be seamlessly integrated with product development.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, cybersecurity teams can and should be present during the design stage of any product. Product and developer teams should consider cybersecurity as a feature. It starts with <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling">threat modeling</a> and continues with secure architecture design. Having security integrated in the development process can significantly reduce debugging time as developers start to think more rigorously about their code.</li>
<li>Second, security teams need to design security guardrails for the current development process for developers. This typically means having internal tools and processes to keep the developers from committing obvious mistakes and letting them harden software by default. One example of this is how <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-aardvark-and-repokid-53b081bf3a7e">Repokid implements least privileged access</a> by removing unused access permissions automatically.</li>
<li>Security can actually increase sales and business results. The report “<a href="https://consumergoods.com/report-cyber-security-can-boost-retail-revenue">Cyber Security, The New Source of Competitive Advantage for Retailers</a>” by Capgemini showed an increase in consumer confidence for companies that implemented (and communicated) proper cybersecurity measures. For developer teams, it is often a business need to deliver a secure product that will stand the subsequent pentests.</li>
<li>Security teams must be looked at to flag the cybersecurity skills gap within the organization and facilitate a solid learning culture by setting up access to security code reviews, <a href="https://platform.avatao.com/discover/paths">hold security workshops and training for developers</a> and more importantly <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/leifdreizler/work-with-developers-for-fun-and-progress-appsec-california">motivate security contributions by all developer teams</a> within the organization.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Make security requirements a feature</strong></h2>
<p>The fundamental building block of secure product design is to <strong>make security a feature</strong> requirement: apply security by design, make security guardrails for the software delivery processes and finally to build a security-aware developer culture.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><em>What are the key benefits of a practical security training for developers? Here are some tips on how you can build a case for a developer security program.</em></p>
<div class="blog_content">
<h2 id="&quot;human-errors&quot;">Security training for developers: More urgent than ever</h2>
<p>Your workforce could be your biggest strength… and yet it could just turn out to be your biggest weakness!</p>
<p>To err is human, everyone makes them. Not making any is certainly impossible, but there are some processes organisations can implement to reduce the chances of those errors occuring.</p>
<p>I’m here to talk about coding errors developers make that increase the probability of your organisation to be breached and why you need to pay attention.</p>
<p>Research shows that <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/the-role-of-human-error-in-successful-security-attacks/">95% of security attacks</a> were undertaken because of human errors.</p>
<p>Yes, you read correctly, 95%… The logical thinking process drives people to replace or automate every process with tools. However, you can buy all the tools on the market, but if your people are not well trained, breaches will still keep happening.</p>
<p>59% of the respondents to <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/the-role-of-human-error-in-successful-security-attacks/">another research </a>agreed that most of security threats discovered were caused by negligence from their internal teams. Over the years, companies have been financing such tools to monitor and control potential leaks of information, misconfigurations in code, which has reduced human involvement in this particular area. As this continues, security threats and breaches have increasingly expanded. If we were to compare the first quarter of 2018 and 2019, the number of data breaches has increased by 56.4%.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://dev2ops.org/2010/02/people-over-process-over-tools/">Choose people over tools</a></strong></h2>
<p>Developers make those mistakes accidentally because they are not being actively involved in feeling responsible for the security of their own codes. They’d rather entirely count on their own security team or tools to monitor what they wrote, only after they wrote it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fixing a vulnerability will always remain more expensive than writing secure code from the very beginning</em></strong>. Some companies try to react to this by giving a one-time training every year, however, without continuous security training for developers, their knowledge rapidly becomes redundant as new types of vulnerabilities come up constantly. That’s the hard part of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/03/02/yahoo-punishes-ceo-marissa-mayer-hacks-cost-firm-350-million/">Yahoo 2014 breach</a>, where the data of 500 million users was compromised, after their management refused to pay attention to the comment of a VP of engineering, warning them about a vulnerabilities list that needed to be prioritised and checked. The management refused to fund it. This lack of attention cost $350 million to the company. With properly trained employees, your team can save you millions of dollars. Believe it or not, investing in security training is a smart long-term investment.</p>
<p>While this is common knowledge that organisations are growing their annual budget for security, mostly spent on buying scanning tools, it’s quite worrying to learn that only <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/12-reasons-why-data-breaches-still-happen/">53% of IT teams</a> are uncertain of the efficiency and operations of the tools they deploy. The preeminent issue with using tools is that developers only see the errors being reported without learning how to avoid them in the future. The wrong idea here is to think that if you buy this very expensive tool, your organisation will be secure. Tools require a lot of knowledge from the developers themselves. If the developers are not properly trained on security</p>
<p>Tools can be helpful (in certain ways), but their outputs are going to be analysed by the developers in the end, resulting in extra work for them, just later in the process. Tools should not be considered as the answer for securing your organisation anymore, it is time secure code training takes that spot!</p>
<h2><strong>The key benefits of a practical security training for developers</strong></h2>
<p>Organisations needs to start involving their developers in issues pertaining to security. After all, they are the ones producing the lines of code. The biggest red flag we observed with companies is that security is often seen as an obstacle for developers to deliver their projects on time – or to their productivity – and because of that, remains at the bottom of the priority list. However, here are some of the outcomes that can be observed after a well-planned <a href="https://avatao.com/solutions-for-developers/">security training</a> for developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reduces the length of QA testing and retesting phases as code is less likely to contain security defects.</li>
<li>It decreases the total cost of fixing vulnerabilities as bugs are discovered and remediated much earlier in the SDLC.</li>
<li>It decreases existing delays in product development as engineers apply cleaner and better code during the development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Skill gap in the security industry</strong></h2>
<p>One last alarming matter before I close this blog post is the lack of security professionals available on the market. In <a href="https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-global-information-security-survey-2018-19/$FILE/ey-global-information-security-survey-2018-19.pdf">EY’s Global Information Security Report 2018-19</a>, they stated that we’ll be facing a shortage of 1.8 million security professionals over the next five years. It’s already hard to find good and experienced security people today (because they already have a job), but it will only become increasingly difficult in the coming years. It is time to strengthen your development teams from within, it surely will be an investment that is worth it, even though it is hard to see now.</p>
<h2><strong>Closing lines</strong></h2>
<p><strong>As laid out in this post, human factors such as skill gaps in cybersecurity in companies, the ever-changing cybersecurity threats landscape, the increasing sophistication of security attacks and the lack of knowledge of end users, undoubtedly remain one of the main security threats for organisations today. While the first move of most of the companies is to go look for tools and other technologies to overcome this threat, nothing can replace continuously educating your employees with the right training and hire skilled security people.</strong></p>

<div class="blog_content">
<p>Not a single day goes by without a devastating security breach affecting someone, somewhere. In the first six months of 2019 alone, <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/&quot;">over 4 billion </a>records around the globe have been exposed due to easily preventable data leaks. The number of breaches have already witnessed a whopping <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-breaches-increased-54-in-2019-so-far/&quot;">54 percent increase</a> from last year. Some recognizable company profiles subject to such damaging circumstances include <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/252467602/2019-data-breach-disclosures-10-of-the-biggest-so-far&quot;">Capital One, Citrix, LabCorp, Toyota, and Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The most common takeaway is that organizations are slipping when it comes to proper security defense, whereas malicious hackers are becoming too sophisticated and adaptable to prevent recurring threats. However, if you take a few steps back, you will find that fundamental security knowledge, although vital, is severely lacking from the very cradle – or college campus.</p>
<p><strong>Missing cybersecurity syllabus</strong></p>
<p>Top white-hat hacker, Jack Cable notes that <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/08/every-computer-science-degree-should-require-a-course-in-cybersecurity&quot;">“universities are partly to blame”</a> for what seems to be increasing organizational unpreparedness and the prevalence of poor security practices. Indeed, among the <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://gist.github.com/cablej/f272747f2d545342aec7f34a1bfae4ef&quot;">top 20 computer science schools</a> in the U.S., only one lists a security course as a core requirement. Another 2016 study showed that only 1 of the top 36 computer science programs in the country required a cybersecurity course for graduation, and 3 of the top 10 programs <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.cloudpassage.com/company/press-releases/cloudpassage-study-finds-u-s-universities-failing-cybersecurity-education/&quot;">offered no cybersecurity classes</a> at all. In 2018, the professional association ISACA found that 61 percent of organizations believed that <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/&quot;">fewer than half of all applicants</a> for open cybersecurity positions were actually qualified for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Theory but no practice</strong></p>
<p>Even when educational institutions do include cybersecurity within the curriculum, the most common complaint is that it tends to<a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap&quot;"> over-emphasize theory and book learning</a>, leaving students with a shortage of hands-on, practical skills. The cybersecurity training nonprofit organization U.S. Cyber Challenge notes, “the common thread across <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap&quot;">the most effective</a> public, private, domestic, or international cyber workforce training programs is hands-on, applied learning methods.”</p>
<p><strong>Hands-on solutions</strong></p>
<p>While some propose <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/08/every-computer-science-degree-should-require-a-course-in-cybersecurity&quot;">standardized courses</a> that would teach the basics of building secure software, including popular security vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and application security – others found success with incorporating <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Events/Federal-Information-Systems-Security-Educators-As/documents/24.pdf.&quot;">cyber ranges</a> and <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/07/27/building-workforce-through-cybersecurity-competitions&quot;">cybersecurity competitions</a> that mimic real-world environments and enable participants to “build practical skills while also <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap&quot;">improving their ability to work as teams</a> in fast-paced, adversarial environments.”</p>
<p><strong>Avatao addresses the gap</strong></p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://avatao.com/back-to-school-cybersecurity-is-missing-on-college-campuses/&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/cybersecurity-expert-shortage-may-cost-companies-hundreds-of-millions.html&quot;">shortage of nearly 3 million cybersecurity experts</a> around the world, most of our clients come to us facing similar challenges. Too much theory, ineffective or insufficient classroom-style learning, not enough assurance in secure coding skills. <strong>“Companies are struggling to find and hire qualified staff, whereas traditional training methods are simply too costly and time-consuming,”</strong> says Avatao CEO, Mark Felegyhazi. Avatao’s first-of-its-kind security training platform was launched within a university environment and is therefore adept at addressing and filling security gaps most commonly found among developers and engineers. <strong>“We developed a platform that’s fun, intuitive, and engaging – but also rigorous and powerfully equipped to teach secure coding to a wide variety of individuals”</strong>. Mark also highlights that CTFs and Hackathons are widely sought after by clients as <strong>“introductory events”</strong> that <strong>“probe existing knowledge”</strong> and <strong>“generate enthusiasm”</strong> among developers for future learning.</p>
<p>It’ll take some time before cybersecurity is fully ingrained across computer science curriculums, therefore pushing companies to search for alternative solutions in the meantime. Whether it’s through traditional learning, workshops, or hands-on training via online platforms – invest in your fresh graduates and existing employees. They’re your first line of defense.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard about the recent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the Google search engine. With a clever payload, you could have crafted a link which executes JavaScript after opening it and clicking into the input box.</p>
<p>The bug was found by <a href="https://twitter.com/kinugawamasato?lang=en" target="&quot;_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masato Kinugawa</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG7U3fuNw3A" target="&quot;_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveOverflow has made a video about it</a> which went viral!! (it really is worth it to check it out, plus you can find a lot of additional great stuff on his YouTube channel as well).</p>
<p>The video clearly explains the bug, but practice makes perfect so we’ve created a <a href="https://next.avatao.com/" target="&quot;_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial challenge</a> about the bug, where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploit the same vulnerability</strong></li>
<li>Play with the HTML parser of your browser</li>
<li>See how the vulnerable version of the sanitizer worked</li>

<p>Also we think it’s worth highlighting the key elements and main points of the story, which is also the goal of this post.</p>

<h2 id="&quot;dealing-with-user-input&quot;">Dealing with user input</h2>
<p>Simply encoding special characters could have prevented the issue, but… in some cases you want to allow some HTML tags, for example when writing emails (formatting text, inserting links and images). It means you have to actually parse the code and remove its unwanted parts, like JavaScript and exotic attributes.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;then-lets-sanitize-it-on-the-client-side&quot;">Then let’s sanitize it on the client-side</h2>
<p>It sounds really wrong – so why would Google do that? Because parsing HTML isn’t as easy as you may think. The specification is really complex and the implementation can be different in the browsers as well. Additionally, browsers don’t just simply parse the HTML – they’re fixing malformed code, completing missing tags, paying attention to headers, loading external resources. Implementing and maintaining a library for that would be really hard – especially because of the different versions of the different browsers. I guess using the client for that makes more sense now.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;but-how-to-do-it-securely&quot;">But how to do it securely?</h2>
<p>There’s a very special <code class="&quot;language-plaintext">&lt;template&gt;</code> tag which is perfect for the job. Its content is parsed, but not rendered. That means the browser does its magic (like fixing the missing closing tags), but it won’t execute scripts or load images. The basic concept of sanitizing HTML on the client is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading the user input into a <code class="&quot;language-plaintext">&lt;template&gt;</code> tag and letting the browser parse it</li>
<li>Removing scripts and unwanted tags and attributes (by using a whitelist for example)</li>
<li>The result can now be used securely in the HTML code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="&quot;the-issue&quot;">The issue</h2>
<p>And here comes the <code class="&quot;language-plaintext">&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag which is really special as well. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-noscript-element.html" target="&quot;_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">specification</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code class="&quot;language-plaintext">noscript</code> element <strong>represents nothing if scripting is enabled</strong>, and <strong>represents its children if scripting is disabled</strong>. It’s used to present different markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don’t support scripting, by <strong>affecting how the document is parsed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inside the <code class="&quot;language-plaintext">&lt;template&gt;</code> element <strong>scripting is disabled</strong>, but in the browser (after using the sanitized HTML in the DOM) <strong>scripting is enabled</strong>. Combining this fact with the helpful behavior of the browsers (where they finish incomplete tags) led to the ultimate payload, which could’ve been used to bypass the Google – Closure and the Cure53 – DOMPurify libraries (both are popular HTML sanitizers):</p>
<div class="&quot;language-plaintext">
<div class="&quot;highlight&quot;">
<pre class="&quot;highlight&quot;"><code>&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p title='&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;'&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>It’s parsed inside the template element like this:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6053" data-permalink="https://avatao.com/xss-case-study/scripts-disabled/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?fit=1720%2C152&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1720,152" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scripts-disabled" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?fit=300%2C27&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?fit=1024%2C90&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6053 jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled" src="https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?resize=1170%2C103&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?w=1720&amp;ssl=1 1720w, https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?resize=300%2C27&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?resize=1024%2C90&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?resize=768%2C68&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?resize=1536%2C136&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-disabled.png?resize=1200%2C106&amp;ssl=1 1200w" data-lazy-loaded="1" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" width="1170" height="103" /></p>
<p>But when it’s used in a scripting enabled context it becomes:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6054" data-permalink="https://avatao.com/xss-case-study/scripts-enabled/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?fit=1727%2C211&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1727,211" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scripts-enabled" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?fit=300%2C37&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?fit=1024%2C125&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6054 jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled" src="https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?resize=1170%2C143&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?w=1727&amp;ssl=1 1727w, https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?resize=300%2C37&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?resize=1024%2C125&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?resize=768%2C94&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?resize=1536%2C188&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/avatao.com/file/2020/04/scripts-enabled.png?resize=1200%2C147&amp;ssl=1 1200w" data-lazy-loaded="1" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" width="1170" height="143" /></p>
<p>And boom – the <code class="&quot;language-plaintext">alert(1)</code> is executed. It’s a really awesome example of how weird browsers can be and a motivation for all the bug bounty hunters out there. I bet almost none of us thought that we’d see a working XSS on the homepage of Google.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;how-could-it-have-been-avoided&quot;">How could it have been avoided?</h2>
<p>The funny thing is that they (at Google) <strong>knew about this attack vector</strong> already and <strong>fixed the code a long time ago</strong>. However they didn’t add any unit tests and when someone later reverted it, the build passed (because it didn’t break the non-existent test) and the vulnerability ended up in the production code. So I think the most important takeway from the story is <strong>tests are really important</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;why&quot;">Why?</h2>
<p>I’ve seen the video multiple times, checked many-many comments about this vulnerability and played with the JS debugger for hours, but none of these could answer <strong>why was the user input parsed as HTML in the search engine?</strong>, which is the real question here I think. But even if it wasn’t the case – the payload probably could’ve worked in GMail.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;lets-play&quot;">Let’s play</h2>
<p>Now it’s your time to analyze the bug interactively by solving our <a href="https://next.avatao.com/" target="&quot;_blank&quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial challenge</a> about it. Have fun!</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Everyone is already familiar with the expression “data is the new oil”. Ever-increasing amounts of information are produced, stored, processed and transferred enabling products and services across all industries. A substantial amount of this information relates to an identified or identifiable natural person i.e., it’s personal data. The processing of personal data can, unfortunately, also summon risks to individuals’ rights and freedoms, sometimes materializing in </span><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-breach/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html" style="font-size: 19px;">real harm</a><span style="font-size: 19px;">. Henceforth, data protection laws have been introduced around the globe to safeguard people from informational harms. The cornerstone of the European Union’s data protection framework is the </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" style="font-size: 19px;">General Data Protection Regulation</a><span style="font-size: 19px;"> (everyone’s favorite GDPR).</span></p>
<div class="blog_content">
<p>Applicable since May 25 2018 the GDPR brings many novelties compared to its <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.1995.281.01.0031.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:1995:281:TOC">predecessor</a> e.g., the principle of accountability, the concepts of data protection by design and by default, and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="&quot;data-protection-impact-assessments&quot;">Data Protection Impact Assessment</h2>
<p>As mandated by <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/">Art. 35 GDPR</a>(2018): “Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data.”</p>
<p>The list of processing activities that require a DPIA includes (but isn’t restricted to) the systematic and extensive profiling with significant effect, the processing on a large scale of sensitive data or the large-scale systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area. Quite impractically, the template of a DPIA is far from set in stone, and there’s only a minimum set of contents: a systematic <strong>description of the processing</strong> operation; an assessment of the <strong>necessity and proportionality</strong> of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; and the <strong>measures</strong> envisaged to address the risks. Even if the risk assessment part could entail some kind of scoring with regard to the level of a given risk, the current DPIA is predominantly a qualitative assessment with potentially arbitrary outcomes!</p>
<h2 id="&quot;lets-make-it-quantitative&quot;">Let’s make it quantitative</h2>
<p><strong>DPIAs</strong> hold promise for turning out to be the most <strong>useful</strong> novelties of the GDPR. A properly executed DPIA can be a major asset for <strong>every stakeholder</strong>: it can enhance the protection level of data subject, help data controllers develop and demonstrate compliance and provide needed information to the data protection authorities. We argue that in certain cases adding a quantitative element to an otherwise qualitative DPIA could mitigate the subjectivity/randomness within, thus fostering informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Equipped with numbers on the estimated impact of risks associated with a given data processing, the following benefits could follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data controllers could <strong>evaluate risk profiles of alternative solutions</strong> in the system design/implementation time. Furthermore, as a new review of DPIA is due whenever the risk profile of a given processing changes, controllers could assess the change at risks more objectively.</li>
<li>When <strong>comparing DPIAs performed by different controllers, on similar processing instances</strong>, competent authorities could contrast their levels of accuracy against one another. Likewise, a controller could contest a negative decision taken by authorities, by referring to a similar DPIA from a different controller.</li>
<li><strong>Hard acceptance criteria</strong> could be set with regard to <strong>IT/process development</strong> and privacy by design and by default.</li>
<li>A tool for product owners and system designers to help them <strong>convince upper management</strong> to invest in the development of privacy enhancing technologies (Return on Privacy Investment, RoPI).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also important to note the limitations of using a quantitative method:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>We explicitly advocate for an <strong>integrated qualitative-plus-quantitative DPIA </strong></li>
<li><strong>In practice, only processing activities that yield particular risk profiles owing to their scale or scope should be characterized via a quantitative assessment. This helps SMEs keep the cost of compliance more affordable.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>While the approach itself is technology-neutral, its implementation must inherently and necessarily be completely sector and technology specific given the vast array of different potential processing instances.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the previously mentioned benefits and limitations, one can argue that the low-hanging fruit for a <strong>quantitative Data Protection Impact Assessment is software application development</strong>. Apps are ubiquitously present, app families use the same platforms and access similar personal data categories through the same permissions, only a few de facto platforms exist (think mobile, social, cloud and fintech categories).</p>
<h2 id="&quot;thought-experiment-cambridge-analytica&quot;">Thought experiment: Cambridge Analytica</h2>
<p>As it has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election">reported</a> at several major news outlets already in 2015 and again in 2018, approximately 50 million Facebook (FB) profiles have been harvested by Aleksandr Kogan’s app, “thisisyourdigitallife”, through his company Global Science Research (GSR) in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica. This data has been used to draw a detailed psychological profile for every person affected, which in turn enabled CA to target them with personalized political ads potentially affecting the outcome of the 2016 US presidential elections.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, Facebook provides an API and a set of permissions that allows third-party apps to directly gain access and transfer the information of users to app providers (1 “user” permission per attribute in the deprecated API v1.0). Up until 2014, the profile information of a user could also be acquired when a friend of a user installed an app embodying <a href="https://fc13.ifca.ai/proc/10-1.pdf">interdependent privacy</a> on Facebook. In short, when a friend installed an app, the app could request and be granted access to the profile information of a user such as the birthday, current location, and history (1 “friend” permission per attribute in the deprecated API v1.0). The user herself was not aware whether a friend had installed an app collecting his/her information, so this was <a href="https://blog.crysys.hu/2018/03/interdependent-privacy-in-effect-the-collateral-damage-of-third-party-apps-on-facebook/">collateral damage</a>. By default, almost all profile information of a user could be accessed by their friends’ applications, unless they manually unchecked the relevant boxes in a not so visible menu. Many apps made use of this mechanism; let us now consider the imaginary average App X.</p>
<p>Suppose that App X v1.0 asked for 5 personal attributes directly from a user installing (corresponding to 5 distinct “user” permissions). Now suppose that the company developing App X hired a new programmer, who was a real wiz with the Facebook API. He went back to the drawing board and added the requests for 3 “friend” permissions. This way App X v2.0 collected 5 personal data items directly and 3 personal attributes indirectly from the friends of the user installing (3 distinct “friend” permissions). Note, that an average user had around 200 friends. A quick calculation yields the amount of personal data items gained per app install: 1<em>5 + 200</em>3 = 605. Taking this further, the developer company made an adoption forecast for their App X that showed a promising 100,000 active users in a couple of months. So, in a short amount of time App X v2.0 was estimated to collect 60,500,000 personal data items as opposed to v1.0’s 500,000 (the sheer amount of personal data items collected grew 121-fold).</p>
<p>Consider that risk equals likelihood times impact. The likelihood that an average Facebook user’s data is taken by App X grew 201-fold. Moreover, the impact per user slightly dipped from 5 collected data items to 3.01. In total, the risk grew 201/3.01 = 66.8-fold, a severe increase, which would then warrant further inspection from the company, were the GDPR applicable in 2014! (Note, that the calculation is simplified omitting overlapping friend circles and personal data items of clearly different sensitivity, among others).</p>
<p>The example above shows a very specific implementation of a generic quantitative Data Protection Impact Assessment approach. <strong>This case study also hints that data protection professionals should work shoulder-to-shoulder with IT platform experts when carrying out a DPIA!</strong></p>
